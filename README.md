World Economic Indicator - A project by Coding Ninjas
Problem Statement:
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a
department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable
growth. This organisation hires you as a data analyst for this department to
determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.
Now, they provide you with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which
has different countries' and regions' GDPs, populations, and other factors that might
impact GDP/Capita. Now using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can
be referred to as “how a country can attain sustainable growth“.
